    <h2>Krishna</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Krishna</b> (/ˈkrɪʃnə/,[12] pronounced [ˈkr̩ʂɳɐ] (About this soundlisten); Sanskrit: कृष्ण, IAST: Kṛṣṇa) is a major deity in Hinduism. He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and also as the supreme God in his own right.[13] He is the god of protection, compassion, tenderness, and love[14][1] and is one of the most popular and widely revered among Indian divinities.[15] Krishna's birthday is celebrated every year by Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar, which falls in late August or early September of the Gregorian calendar.<div><img src="Lord-Krishna-Pictures.jpg" alt="A picture of Lord Krishna" width="350px"></div>

    <p>The anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as Krishna Leela. He is a central character in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana, the Brahma Vaivarta Purana and the Bhagavad Gita, and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical, theological, and mythological texts.[18] They portray him in various perspectives: a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and as the universal supreme being.[19] His iconography reflects these legends, and shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating butter, a young boy playing a flute, a young boy with Radha or surrounded by women devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna.</p>
    <p>The name and synonyms of Krishna have been traced to 1st millennium BCE literature and cults.[21] In some sub-traditions, Krishna is worshipped as Svayam Bhagavan (the Supreme God) and it sometimes known as Krishnaism. These sub-traditions arose in the context of the medieval era Bhakti movement.[22][23] Krishna-related literature has inspired numerous performance arts such as Bharatanatyam, Kathakali, Kuchipudi, Odissi, and Manipuri dance.[24][25] He is a pan-Hindu god, but is particularly revered in some locations such as Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh,[26] Dwarka and Junagadh in Gujarat; the Jagannatha aspect in Odisha, Mayapur in West Bengal;[22][27][28] in the form of Vithoba in Pandharpur, Maharashtra, Shrinathji at Nathdwara in Rajasthan,[22][29] Udupi Krishna in Karnataka,[30] Parthasarathy in Tamil Nadu, Parthasarathy in Aranmula, Kerala and Guruvayoorappan in Guruvayoor in Kerala.[31] Since the 1960s, the worship of Krishna has also spread to the Western world and to Africa, largely due to the work of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).</p>
