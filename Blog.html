    <p><b id="my">Myths</b></p>
    <p>Firstly, I would like to state that there has always been a misconception that shyness and introversion are same. But that’s not the case.</p>
    <p>Shyness and Introversion are not same. Introversion is a personality trait in which a person focuses on internal feeling rather than external source of stimulation. What I feel about introversion is that its positively healthy. Introversion has its own advantages. Leadership is one those advantages. The reason behind introverts being great leaders is that they are guided by their own values and can make difficult decisions through careful analysis.</p>
    <p>Whereas Shyness is kind of fear where a person thinks about negative reaction from the other side. Few other qualities of a Shy person is low self-esteem, negative self-preoccupation. It’s not that a person is born with shyness. Certain incidents of past leads to this trait. They underestimate themselves. They care more about what others might think and react to their actions.</p>

    Now lets jump to point  how to make friends at college if you are an introvert. <br>
    <p></p>
    1. Aim to make real friends- Introverts might think that its really cool to have too many friends. But it’s not the case. History teaches us everything what we should do and what we should not. Great personalities always had least number of friends. So always try to go for real friends. That can be just 2 or 3 friends. But this will be more fulfilling than being popular by having 20 superficial friends. <br>
    <p></p>
    2. Dont feel guilty- An introvert has to face lot of things and the most common among them is getting teased for wanting to be alone. Those teases may be just out of fun but it still leaves a strong impression on that introverted person. He feels guilty for wanting to spend time with himself while his roommates go to parties. Tell yourself that it’s an excellent quality to be with yourself because you are actually enjoying it and this will be give you energy  to socialize later. <br>
    <p></p>
    3. Look for other fringe dwellers—Always remember that there are many students who prefer to do their work instead of going behind crowds. Try to look for these people. It will be easier for you to connect with these people because of similar choices.
    4. Campus Events-Every person has a talent. So try to participate in that particular event in which you are good it and you will automatically make friends. <br>
    <p></p>
    5. Keep a smile on your face – Smiling creates a positive atmosphere which in turn attracts positive people towards you. <br>
    <p></p>
    6. Making friends on your course- As you have opted for a particular course so its quite sure that there will be other students in that course. That’s the best way to make friends because you all are studying something which you all love. Try to share your goals with people around you in a polite manner when you feel that you can trust them. Sharing goal helps creating a realization that you all are in the same boat though your destinations may be different. <br>
    <p>And I would like to end this by saying this that if you still think these steps are difficult for you, try to find your own steps. Life is very different from exam. In exam every student gets same question paper. But life throws different question paper every time and its your job to solve it and reach the top.</p>
