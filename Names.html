    <h2>Names and epithets</h2>
<p>The name "Krishna" originates from the Sanskrit word Kṛṣṇa, which is primarily an adjective meaning "black", "dark", "dark blue" or “the all attractive”.[33] The waning moon is called Krishna Paksha, relating to the adjective meaning "darkening".[33] The name is also interpreted sometimes as "all-attractive".[34]

    As a name of Vishnu, Krishna is listed as the 57th name in the Vishnu Sahasranama. Based on his name, Krishna is often depicted in idols as black- or blue-skinned. Krishna is also known by various other names, epithets, and titles that reflect his many associations and attributes. Among the most common names are Mohan "enchanter"; Govinda "chief herdsman",[35] Keev "prankster", and Gopala "Protector of the 'Go'", which means "Soul" or "the cows".[36][37] Some names for Krishna hold regional importance; Jagannatha, found in Puri Hindu temple, is a popular incarnation in Odisha state and nearby regions of eastern India.[38][39][40]
    
    Krishna may also be referred to as Vāsudeva-Krishna, Murlidhar, and Chakradhar. The honorary title "Sri" (also spelled "Shri") is often used before the name of Krishna.</p>
